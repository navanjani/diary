# Map Function in React
    The map() function is used to iterate over an array and manipulate or change data items __without mutating the original array__. In React, the map() function is most commonly used for rendering a list of data to the DOM.

* To use the map() function, attach it to an array you want to iterate over. The map() function expects a callback as the argument and executes it once for each element in the array. From the callback parameters, you can access the current element, the current index, and the array itself. The map() function also takes in an optional second argument, which you can pass to use as this inside the callback. Each time the callback executes, the returned value is then added to a new array.

* Eg - 
const num = [3, 8, 11, 7, 5];

const num2x = num.map((n) => n * 2);

console.log(num2x); // [6, 16, 22, 14, 10]
